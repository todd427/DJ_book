Absolutely! Here’s a clean, informative `README.md` you can use for your Django book lookup project. This assumes your app is called `booklookup` and your project is using the features seen in your uploaded code.

# Book Lookup Django App

A simple Django web application to search for books by author name, aggregate results from Open Library and Google Books, and display purchase links (including Amazon pricing) for each found book.

## Features

- Search for books by author.
- Aggregates results from Open Library and Google Books.
- Displays book details: title, author, ISBN/ASIN, source, Amazon link, and price.
- Saves found books to the database.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Django 5.x
- [BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) (for price scraping)
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/booklookup.git
   cd booklookup
````

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don’t have a `requirements.txt`, install dependencies manually:

   ```bash
   pip install django beautifulsoup4 requests
   ```

4. **Apply migrations**

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Visit the app**

   Open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser.

## Usage

* Enter an author’s name in the search box and submit.
* View results, including Amazon purchase links and prices (if available).
* All results are saved in the database.

## Customization

* **Amazon Prices:** The app scrapes Amazon for prices, which may break if Amazon changes their page layout.
* **API Keys:** For Google Books, you may use an API key for higher rate limits. Update the code if needed.

## Troubleshooting

* If you see `no such table: booklookup_book`, make sure you have run the migrations:

  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

* For other issues, check the Django documentation or open an issue.
